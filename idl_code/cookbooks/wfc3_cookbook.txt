Instructions for reducing spectral data with the Bohlin/Lindler IDL codes,
adapted by RB to the WFC3 IR grisms. 

The following routines are used.
--------------------------------
angle.pro - determine the mean angle and rms for the extracted PN spectra
makeff.pro -  Make a Scanned FF from avg of images offset in X by 4" 2012Jul23
 Use ibtw01q6q at X-postarg=66 and ibtw01q7q, ibtw01q8q at X-postarg=62 to make
 FF. Then test on the independent obs ibtw01q9q
wfc_coadd.pro - Plot and Co-add wfc3 spectra
wfcdir.pro - to make the .log files
wfcobs.pro - picks observation subsets from log files
wfcwlfix.pro - adjust WLs of obs where standard extractions have small errors
wleval.pro - try to sort out the AXE WL nonsense. See also wlpub.pro
wlimaz.pro - measure the saturated line (10830A) from the _ima zero-read file
               in +1st order
wlmake.pro - makes the disp constants coef in Table 3 and evaluates the results
	for Tables 4-5 of ISR
wlmeas.pro -  collect meas of PN em lines for making dispersion relations
wlpn.pro - Lookat all the ref. PN spectra from susana and tabulate the eff WL of
	the features
wlpub.pro - Make figs 3-4 cf. w/ aXe for ISR
ws.pro - general purpose routine to find px location of a wavelength.
zoeval.pro - evaluate accuracy and any systematic blue/red asymm of ZOrder


To extract spectra from grism images run:
prewfc.pro, which uses subroutines:
	calwfc_imagepos.pro*
	calwfc_spec.pro - to extract wfc3 point source spectrum from a 
								calibrated image
	calwfc_spec_wave - to compute wavelength vector and column numbers to 
		extract
	calnic_spec_flat - to flat field the data with wavelength depended flats
	wfc_flatscal.pro - function, returns scaled Flat Field per background of
	       data image for use in calwfc_spec
	wfc_process.pro - to run calwfc_spec on list of files in a dir*.log file
		calls only wfcobs, calwfc_imagepos, & calwfc_spec +TBD co-adding
	wfc_wavecal.pro - make WFC3 IR Grism wavelength vector from 0-order
		position
OUTPUT : spec_ files for stare mode and imag_ files for scanned obs

.r mrgall - to merge allthe prewfc output into 1 file per star.

OPERATION - see also tchang.pro
---------
1.  run wfcdir.pro to make dirwfc.log for the data you want to reduce.
in idl: wfcdir,'directory path'
- create a new dirtemp.log, then do a tkdiff between the dirtemp.log and the old
*cf.log file to see if there's anything new
- Update the new lines & mv temp.log to dirwfc-cf.log, (eg.) or rename the
dirtemp.log to dirwfc.log (eg.), But do NOT overwrite comments in orig. 
dirwfc.log !
- Update wfcdir to add coordinates for any new star w/ significant Proper Motion
or bad coord.

2. run prewfc.pro to reduce the data
this program will extract spectra of the two WFC3/IR grisms, selected by
aperture.

OPTIONS:
-------
a. wfcobs,'dirwfc.log',obs,grat,aper,star,'','',' ; use this to extract
	all the spectra.
b. wfc_process,star(i),obs(i),/before,direct=dir,dirlog=dirlog	$
	,/displ,/trace			$ ; helps debugging & understanding
;	,grism='g141'
	,flatfile='none'	;,/dirimg ;-for dir img ref, not Z-order
c. /dirimg uses the direct image and the Kuntschner dispersion constants in program
calwfc_spec_wave in calwfc_spec.pro file.
Otherwise, use my new dispersion constants in wfc_wavecal.pro per the logic in
calwfc_spec.

3a. .r wavoff.pro & update wfcwlfix.pro

3b. .r tchang.pro

3c. .r wfcmrg to make merged spectra

3d. .r sens, if any changes or new obs.

4. run wleval-cont to see repeatability and fix glitches (mostly by editing
calwfc_spec.pro).

wlpub.pro - comparision w/ 'aXe uses files named spec/spec_i*pn.fits for my disp
constants and spec/spec_i*q.fits (w/o pn) for aXe disp constants.

Example: G141
ic6906byq  F139M star at  xc,yc=    861.976      955.352 yes, ckd.
ic6906bzq  g141 zord at ~613,955 ie: Zero Order at: x,y= 612.382  954.914  yes.
Use "measured" targ posit:       796.15779       955.88742, ie xc,yc adjusted
	for a 'standard' hidden dither when moving from direct to grism. So add
	keywords xactual,yactual for dir img actual xc,yc.
----ACTUALLY, this hidden dither is only for this one (SED) proposal that used
	the IR ref position, where the ref. pixel is 65px off from the direct
	image ref. px. BUT this is the ONLY case where this oddity occurs!!!

	plus Petro offsets. In other words, the predicted x,y shifts at dir
	image position must differ from the x,y offsets at 506,506 !!!

	a small inconsistency is that some aXe extracts are not done, when the
	there is NO direct image. BUT for the ZOE, all are done, even if the 
	Z-order is off image. The Astrometry is good enough to find the orders.
