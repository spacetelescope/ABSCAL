# This file contains the name of the WFC3-specific calibration files that have been 
# defined so far. It produces a mapping from exposure parameters (e.g. grism, filter, 
# spectral order, etc.) to a reference file (where the reference file is itself also found 
# in the data directory).
#
# The format is:
#
#   reference_file_type: reference_file_name
#
# if there is only one possible reference file for that reduction stage, or
#
#   reference_file_type:
#       keyword: reference_file_name_1
#       keyword: reference_file_name_2
#       keyword: reference_file_name_3
#
# if there are multiple possible reference files based on some keyword.
