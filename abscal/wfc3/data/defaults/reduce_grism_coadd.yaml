# These are the default parameters for the coadd() function in reduce_grism_coadd. 
#
# The file is are formatted in ABSCAL's own idiosyncratic (yet quietly brilliant) defaults 
# dictionary format. That format consists of:
#
#   - an "all:" tag. Put any actual values here
#   - zero or more keyword tags. These are for parameters that vary based on the input 
#     (e.g. a different set of defaults for each grism, spectral order, etc.)
#   - each keyword tag itself contains a defaults dictionary, which means that it *also* 
#     has an "all" tag containing any actual values, and zero-or-more keyword tags that 
#     lead to yet-more-specific dictionaries (e.g. if you need to specify grism *and* 
#     order).
#
# The defaults dictionary itself will comment each value keyword with what it is, and 
# what data type it is expected to have.
