# These are the default parameters for the coadd() function in util_grism_cross_correlate. 
#
# The file is are formatted in ABSCAL's own idiosyncratic (yet quietly brilliant) defaults 
# dictionary format. That format consists of:
#
#   - an "all:" tag. Put any actual values here
#   - zero or more keyword tags. These are for parameters that vary based on the input 
#     (e.g. a different set of defaults for each grism, spectral order, etc.)
#   - each keyword tag itself contains a defaults dictionary, which means that it *also* 
#     has an "all" tag containing any actual values, and zero-or-more keyword tags that 
#     lead to yet-more-specific dictionaries (e.g. if you need to specify grism *and* 
#     order).
#
# The defaults dictionary itself will comment each value keyword with what it is, and 
# what data type it is expected to have.

all:
    ishift: 0               # int. Initial pixel shift to use
    width: 15               # int. Width of the window to use for cross-correlating
    i1: 0                   # int. First pixel of spectrum to look at
    i2: -1                  # int. Last pixel of spectrum to look at. Set by the script to 
                            #           len(first_spectrum) - 1
                            #      so not set as a default here, because yaml doesn't do 
                            #      that.
