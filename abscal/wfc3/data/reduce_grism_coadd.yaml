# Exposure-specific parameter settings for reduce_grism_coadd
#
# Settings are in the form of a list for each parameter, with the following format:
#
#   - column: column
#     value: value
#     param_value: param_value
#     source: source
#     reason: reason
#
# where column/value identifies the exposure or exposures (by exact match), param_value is 
# the value that the parameter in the parent list should be set to, source is the IDL file 
# where the parameter was found (set to N/A if from a different source), and reason 
# explains why the parameter needed to be changed.
