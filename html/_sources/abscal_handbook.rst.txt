ABSCAL Project Definition
-------------------------

.. note:: 

    The following text is adapted from text written by Dr. Susana Deustua and Dr. Linda 
    Smith when proposing the ABSCAL project.

The spectro-photometric calibration of the HST instruments has relied on the efforts of 
Dr. Bohlin, and his personal IDL programs. Many of the programs files have been adapted, 
ad hoc, for the various instruments, and are idiosyncratic and not suitably documented for 
the general user i.e. they are highly personal and require manual changes to adapt to a 
new mode.  There are several related reasons to undertake this project now:

1. Ralph is likely to retire in the not too distant future, 
2. python is currently the preferred software in the astrophysical research community
3. the basic calibration software for STSCIâ€™s instruments should be standardized, 
   documented, and relatively easy to use.
