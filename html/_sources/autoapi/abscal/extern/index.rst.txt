====================

.. py:module:: abscal.extern

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This packages contains python packages that are bundled with the package but
   are external to it, and hence are developed in a separate source tree. Note
   that this package is distinct from the /cextern directory of the source code
   distribution, as that directory only contains C extension code.
