Using ABSCAL
============

This section describes running ABSCAL along with a number of its run-time options.

General Usage Notes
-------------------

ABSCAL can currently be run in two ways. Individual parts of ABSCAL can be imported into
python scripts (or in the python interpreter), or command scripts may be run from the
command line. The command scripts are divided into IDL and python versions, where the
IDL versions use the same name as the equivalent IDL commands, and the python versions
use more directly descriptive names.
