ABSCAL Documentation
====================

Overview
--------
ABSCAL is a python implementation of Ralph Bohlin's absolute flux calibration code. The
current implementation includes the WFC3 IR GRISM stare mode. The WFC3 flux calibration is
described in `WFC3 ISR 2015-10 <https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2015/WFC3-2015-10.pdf>`_.

*Ensuring that 30 years of calibration software are useful for the next 30 years.*
