ABSCAL Examples
===============
.. note::

    These examples assume that ABSCAL is installed in the directory $HOME/ABSCAL, and
    each one requires a particular set of data files from MAST_. The example starts after
    you have downloaded any required files, extracted them into a directory, opened
    that directory in your terminal program of choice, and activated the abscal conda
    environment.
